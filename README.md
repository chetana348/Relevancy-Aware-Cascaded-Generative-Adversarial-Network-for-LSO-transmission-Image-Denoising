## ðŸ“„ Background

LSO-based transmission imaging offers a promising path for enabling low-dose, CT-less PET acquisition. However, the inherent low photon statistics of LSO transmission images can result in high levels of noise, limiting their direct use for attenuation correction and anatomical reference.

In this work, we propose a **Relevancy Aware Cascaded GAN architecture** that leverages modified U-Net and Transformer-based hybrid generators to iteratively denoise and refine LSO-transmission images. The proposed model enhances image quality in a stepwise manner, with relevancy feedback at each stage, making it well-suited for producing high-fidelity attenuation maps and improving PET-to-PET/CT translation.
